## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- Little a bit about form actions from the beginning of this project which I had to abandon because heroku now needs a credit card and I don't feel great about that.

### Continued development

- Regex
- Better way to design forms in react/nextjs without experimental form actions
- Deployment of servers for free or cheap with little worry about runaway cost
- Spring boot; goes with above.
